### Technical:

- [React](https://react.dev/learn): is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/): Powerful asynchronous state management for TS/JS, React.
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand):A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution. Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks. It isn't boilerplatey or opinionated, but has enough convention to be explicit and flux-like.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/): React Hook Form reduces the amount of code you need to write while removing unnecessary re-renders.
- [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/): Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start): is a standard library for routing in React.
- Editor: Visual Studio Code.
